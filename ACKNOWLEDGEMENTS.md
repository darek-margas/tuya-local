None of this would have been possible without some foundational discovery work to get me started:

- [nikrolls](https://github.com/nikrolls)'s [homeassistant-goldair-climate](https://github.com/nikrolls/homeassistant-goldair-climate) was the starting point for expanding to non-Goldair devices as well.
- [TarxBoy](https://github.com/TarxBoy)'s [investigation using codetheweb/tuyapi](https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi/issues/31) to figure out the correlation of the cryptic DPS states .
- [sean6541](https://github.com/sean6541)'s [tuya-homeassistant](https://github.com/sean6541/tuya-homeassistant) library giving an example of integrating Tuya devices with Home Assistant.
- [clach04](https://github.com/clach04)'s [python-tuya](https://github.com/clach04/python-tuya) library.
- [jasonacox](https://github.com/jasonacox)'s [tinytuya](https://github.com/jasonacox/tinytuya) library which improves on the original.

Further device support has been made with the assistance of users.  Please consider contributing if you find a device that is not supported by gathering some information about the device's DPS ids and their values.
